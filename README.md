# Why "Zeta" #

Possibly the most important unproven conjecture in number theory is
the
[Riemann Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis)
which is concerned with the zeros of the complex Riemann *Zeta*
function. There are also the "Riemann Sums" of great importance in
analysis, but honestly "zeta" is a cooler name.
